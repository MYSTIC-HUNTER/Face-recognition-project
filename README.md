# face-recognition-project
Face Recognition System is the task of identifying an already detected object as a known or unknown face. This project works on deciding if the "face" is someone known, or unknown, using for this purpose a database of faces in order to validate this input face. Equipped with Eigenfaces, this project can create a dataset in real-time &amp; authenticate the user's facial structure. This system aids in ensuring safety & security against thefts or attacks.
